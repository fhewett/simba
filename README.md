# SIMBA text assistant

## What is SIMBA?

The SIMBA Text Assistant is designed to improve your online reading experience. It is a plug-in that runs in your browser and provides summaries of the text found on web pages. Our models and code are open source. It has been designed for German-language text, but it may work on other languages.

## How does SIMBA work?

The plug-in supports two types of summaries: extractive, where the most important sentences are highlighted on the page, and abstractive, where a new text is generated which reflects the main points in the text. 
We offer both summaries as they both have their advantages: the extractive summary is guaranteed to be accurate, whereas the abstractive summary is a stand-alone text that should be more coherent.

The extractive summary is created using sentence embeddings from [SBERT](https://sbert.net/) and the [LexRank algorithm](https://github.com/crabcamp/lexrank/tree/dev), which is an unsupervised algorithm. The abstractive summary is created using the model [mt5-small](https://huggingface.co/T-Systems-onsite/mt5-small-sum-de-en-v2), which has been fine-tuned with German-language newspaper articles.

## Known limitations

- SIMBA works best on shorter texts
- It has been created for German-language text: it may work on other languages, but it has not been designed to do so
- The abstractive summary may contain false information or ungrammatical phrases
- The abstractive model has been trained using datasets with known biases. Limitations can be found on the respective dataset pages: [CNN Daily Mail](https://huggingface.co/datasets/cnn_dailymail), [XSum](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xsum), [MLSUM](https://huggingface.co/datasets/mlsum), [SwissText](https://www.swisstext.org/2019/shared-task/german-text-summarization-challenge.html).

## Project structure

We use django (Python) on the backend, these files are in the *websvc* folder. The plug-in code is in Javascript and can be found in the folder *highlighter-plugin*.

## Credits

SIMBA has been created by members of the [AI & Society Lab](https://www.hiig.de/en/research/ai-and-society-lab/) at the [Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society](https://www.hiig.de/en/) in Berlin, Germany.
Hadi Asghari, Christopher Richter and Freya Hewett are responsible for the technical aspects, Larissa Wunderlich for the visuals, with general input from Theresa ZÃ¼ger.
