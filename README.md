# SIMBA text assistant

## What is SIMBA?

The SIMBA Text Assistant is designed to improve your online reading experience. It is a plug-in that runs in your browser and provides summaries of the text found on web pages. Our models and code are open source. It has been designed for German-langugage text, but it may work on other languages.

## How does SIMBA work?

The plug-in supports two types of summaries: extractive, where the most important sentences are highlighted on the page, and abstractive, where a new text is generated which reflects the main points in the text. 
We offer both summaries as they both have their advantages: the extractive summary is guaranteed to be accurate, whereas the abstractive summary is a stand-alone text that should be more coherent.
The extractive summary is created using sentence embeddings from [SBERT](https://sbert.net/) and the [LexRank algorithm](https://github.com/crabcamp/lexrank/tree/dev), which is an unsupervised algorithm. The abstractive summary is created using ??, which has been fine-tuned with German-language newspaper articles.

## Known limitations

- SIMBA works best on shorter texts
- It has been created for German-language text: it may work on other languages, but it has not been designed to do so
- The abstractive summary may contain false information or ungrammatical phrases

## Credits

SIMBA has been created by members of the [AI & Society Lab](https://www.hiig.de/en/research/ai-and-society-lab/) at the [Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society](https://www.hiig.de/en/) in Berlin, Germany.
Hadi Asghari, Christopher Richter and Freya Hewett are responsible for the technical aspects, Larissa Wunderlich for the visuals, with general input from Theresa ZÃ¼ger.
